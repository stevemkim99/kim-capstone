# Final Capstone Project

My capstone project for Coding Temple-Data Analyst.

In this project I performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Plotly, built predictive models using KNN, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, and have showcased my results through a Streamlit app.


## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Breast Cancer Dataset", which can be downloaded from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/breast-cancer-dataset). The dataset contains information about patient's tumor sizing, including features such as area, radius, symmetry, and more.


## Tasks
In this project, my primary task is to read the breast cancer dataset into a Jupyter Notebook that I will create. Begin by performing essential data cleaning tasks to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis. Steps taken to clean the data were checking to see if there were any null values in the dataset or checking for any outliers. Once checking for these in the dataset it was ready to create machine learning models. Utilize Plotly for initial exploratory data analysis (EDA), creating interactive visualizations to gain insights into the dataset. Subsequently, employ machine learning techniques, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, and Random Forest, to build predictive models. Evaluate and compare the performance of these models to determine their effectiveness in predicting breast cancer diagnosis. Lastly, present my findings in a Streamlit app, providing an interactive and user-friendly platform to showcase the results of my analysis and model performance. 


## Conclusion
Based off of these findings, there are many many many factors that go into the final diagnosis. The bigger the size of the tumor the more likely the tumor will be malignant. If you or someone you know is needing medical attention please get professional help, do not rely on these models to diagnosis.
